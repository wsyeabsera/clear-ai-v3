## 🔍 Detailed Analysis

### **Phase 1: Database Assessment Results**

**Real Data Discovered:**
- **Facilities**: 3 (Mayerfurt, Test City, Valdosta)
- **Countries**: Ecuador, Test Country, Sint Maarten
- **Shipments**: 3 (8,500 - 23,548 kg range)
- **Inspections**: 3 (66.7% acceptance rate)
- **Contaminants**: 2 (Unknown Chemical, Plastic - PET)
- **Date Ranges**: 2025-01-18 to 2025-09-22 (shipments), 2025-10-19 (inspections/contaminants)

### **Phase 2: Query Intelligence Comparison**

#### **Naive Queries (Previous Test)**
```
❌ "Find all shipments at facilities in New York..." 
   → No data exists for New York
   
❌ "Find facilities with more than 5 contaminant reports..."
   → Only 2 contaminants exist total
   
❌ "Compare waste acceptance rates across countries..."
   → Limited data for meaningful comparison
```

#### **Smart Queries (Current Test)**
```
✅ "Analyze shipments at facilities in Mayerfurt and Test City..."
   → Uses actual cities with data
   
✅ "Review all inspections and identify the acceptance rate..."
   → Uses real 66.7% acceptance rate
   
✅ "Analyze contaminant data: Unknown Chemical, Plastic - PET..."
   → Uses actual contaminant types found
```
